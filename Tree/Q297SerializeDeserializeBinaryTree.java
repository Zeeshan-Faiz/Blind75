/*
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so 
that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link 
to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your 
serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can 
be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do 
not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different 
approaches yourself.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: []
